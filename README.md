# Array cardio 1

This is the fourth project of the Javascript30 challenge.

This JavaScript mini-project, "Array Cardio ðŸ’ª", explores fundamental array manipulation techniques and exercises. Through array methods like filter, map, sort, and reduce, it processes inventors' data and names, and analyzes transportation data, showcasing the power and versatility of JavaScript arrays.


## Concepts utilised in building the project -

1) Array Methods:

filter(): Filters elements of an array based on a condition.
map(): Transforms each element of an array into another value based on a provided function.
sort(): Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.
reduce(): Reduces the array to a single value, applying a function against an accumulator and each element in the array.

2) Destructuring Assignment:

Extracting values from arrays or objects into variables, as seen in splitting names into first and last components.
